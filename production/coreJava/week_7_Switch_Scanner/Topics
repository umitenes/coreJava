Switch-Case
   Switch-case statement used to compare the
       value of a variable with multiple values and
       execute some statements based on the match.
Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break

	syntax:
		switch(Data){

			case data1:
					Statements;
					break;

			case data2:
					Statements;
					break;

			default:
					Statements;
					break;

		}
Case value MUST match with switch' data type and UNIQUE
	Switch' Data can not be long, float, double and boolean data types
	break: used for exiting the switch.
			if we don't give the break statement, switch statement continue to execute the next block(s) until the break statement or } of the switch
	default block gets executed if none of the case blocks matched.
			there can only be one default block
	or logic we can use it in switch by declaring case blocks back to back

Scanner Class
   -- Provides the methods to get inputs
   -- Presented in java.util package
   -- Need to be imported in our program
         import java.util.Scanner

         Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
         input.nextInt();

Scanner Methods
nextByte()      Returns input as a byte
nextShort()     Returns input as a short
nextInt()       Returns input as an int
nextLong()      Returns input as a long
nextFloat()     Returns input as a float
nextDouble()    Returns input as a double
nextBoolean()   Returns input as a boolean
next()          Returns input as a String, reads the input only until a space
nextLine()      Returns input as a String, reads the entire input until the new line (press enter)
            if we are using nextLine() method after the other methods of scanner, we MUST provide one addition nextLine()
